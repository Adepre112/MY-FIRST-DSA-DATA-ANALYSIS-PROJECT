# MY-FIRST-DSA-DATA-ANALYSIS-PROJECT
A detailed description of my first POWER BI PROJECT

### PROJECT TOPIC: DATA ANALYSIS CAPSTONE PROJECT USING POWER BI

### PROJECT OVERVIEW
This analysis is about The Palmoria Group, a manufacturing company based in Nigeria, is embroiled in issues
bordering on gender inequality in its 3 regions. Unfortunately, the media recently
published the news with the headline “Palmoria, the Manufacturing Patriarchy”. This
doesn’t look good for the owners of the business, based on their ambition to scale the
business to other regions and even overseas. Cases like this can only spiral downwards,
revealing other issues like the gender pay gap, amongst other possible issues. I was able to visualize and analyze the data using POWER BI to clean, visualize and analyze the data using POWER BI visualization tools. I have learnt alot ranging from microsoft excel, SQL and Power BI, how to use this tools to visualize and analyze data It has been a great journey all along and I am glad to be able to put all I have learnt into practice.

### DATA SOURCE
DSA DATA ANALYSIS CAPSTONE PROJECT

### TOOLS USED
MICROSOFT POWER BI for data cleaning[Download here](https://www.microsoft.com)
 - for data cleaning
 - for data visualization

### DATA PREPARATION
Use of power bi to clean, sort and visualize data
use of various visuals and dax functions to solve problems and analyze data
Creation of a dashboard for a better, easier and clearer view of the data visualization

### RESULTS AND FINDINGS
 1. What is the gender distribution in the organization? Distil to regions and
departments
2. Show insights on ratings based on gender
3. Analyse the company’s salary structure. Identify if there is a gender pay gap. If
there is, identify the department and regions that should be the focus of
management
4. A recent regulation was adopted which requires manufacturing companies to pay
employees a minimum of $90,000
- Does Palmoria meet this requirement?
-  Show the pay distribution of employees grouped by a band of $10,000. For example:
- How many employees fall into a band of $10,000 – $20,000, $20,000 – $30,000, e.t.c

- Calculate the amount to be paid as a bonus to individual employees
- Calculate the total amount to be paid to individual employees (salary inclusive of
bonus)
- Total amount to be paid out per region and company-wide

### FINAL RESULTS AND FINDINGS
 - Plamoria does not meet the requirements to pay $90000
 - This have all been shown in the dashboard below
